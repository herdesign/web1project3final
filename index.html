    <h1> Do everything in moderation, but fuck it have fun! </h1>
    <p class="aboutp"> I’m a 20 year-old (visual communication designer). My name is Hailey Rodriguez and I am a student of Eastern Washington University. My interest in the artistic fields started at a young age with painting, drawing, sewing and crochet. That interest then molded into my love for design, after taking a Digital Arts and Filmmaking class at Tri-Tech, a trade school in the Tri-cities. I started collecting things like packaging, magazine articles, and screenshots of websites and apps. I would study these pieces and try to figure out why I found them appealing, what makes them stand out to me among everything else on the shelf or on the web. This is what led me to the Visual Communications field of the design world. I want to make things that draw people in and that stand out from the others.

      <p class="funa-cont">This piece was a personal project that I was working on. Something happened and a weird selection happened that looked interesting so I took a screenshot of it. It doesn’t have a purpose right now, but I love little glitches and oddities that happen during the process of creating and designing. Even weird mistakes can be beautiful. </p>

      <p id="albumscont">These two pieces are from the same collection. The prompt was to constrict oneself to a typeface and make an album cover based on limitations. The first one had no limitations and the second was two sizes two weights.

      <p id="confcont">The prompt for this piece was to take a typeface and make it express one of the words in a list of descriptive words. The typeface I chose is called Neuton. The typeface has an ExtraBold style. It was a fun style with some traditional elements that I enjoyed the look of visually. </p>
